      <p>Combining lotteries with the game of chicken.</p>

      <h2>TL/DR</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Send at least one ether to participate and reset the time period.</li>
        <li>Once the time period passes without a participant sending ether, the last participant receives all ether sent by all participants.</li>
        <li>The award, sending address, and time period vary with each lottery.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Monitoring</h2>
      <p><a href="/">lottopollo.iffy.studio</a></p>
      <p>A second opinion: see the etherchain.org monitor link on each individual lottery page.</p>

      <h2>Deployed Code</h2>
      <pre>
contract lottopollo {
  address leader;
  uint    timestamp;
  
  function lottopollo() {
    log(1);
  }
  
  function () {
    if (timestamp > 0 && now - timestamp > 24 hours) { // "24 hours" is the time period, and varies per lottery
      msg.sender.send(msg.value);
      
      if (this.balance > 0) {
        leader.send(this.balance);
        log(4);
      }
      else {
        log(5);
      }
    }
    else if (msg.value >= 1 ether) {
      leader = msg.sender;
      timestamp = now;
      log(2);
    }
    else {
      log(3);
    }
  }
  
  event log(uint status);
}</pre>

      <h2>Simplified Code</h2>
      <p>The above code is what's actually published on the blockchain, and can be used for verification purposes.</p>
      <p>However, the log calls complicate the logic. The same code with the logging removed is:</p>
      <pre>
contract lottopollo {
  address leader;
  uint    timestamp;
    
  function () {
    if (timestamp > 0 && now - timestamp > 24 hours) { // "24 hours" is the time period, and varies per lottery
      msg.sender.send(msg.value);

      if (this.balance > 0) {
        leader.send(this.balance);
      }
    }
    else if (msg.value >= 1 ether) {
      leader = msg.sender;
      timestamp = now;
    }
  }
}</pre>
      <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
      <p>Sending more than one ether is supported. The entire amount sent will be added to the balance.</p>
      <p>Sending less than one ether will also add the entire amount sent to the balance, but will not register the sender as a participant.</p>
      <p>After the posted time period elapses, the contract does not automatically end; instead, any person can send an arbitrary amount of ether to the contract, which will trigger two events:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The sender will have the sending amount returned.</li>
        <li>The entire balance will be awarded to the last participant.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Inadvertently sending ether to the contract after it expires will simply return the ether to the sender.</p>
